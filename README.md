# OTN metadata profile

How to describe your dataset before it can be indexed in an Open Transport Net Hub?

## The vocabulary

We reuse 3 vocabularies:
 * The DCAT vocabulary by W3C
 * The INSPIRE vocabulary
 * ISO Profile

**TODO**

## Methodology for its creation

During 2 meetings (in Antwerp and in Prague), an Open Transport Net Hub was discussed. On the basis of the notes, a first draft has been made in both a scheme and in RDF.

## First Ideas from email communication

A profile combined from ISO, INSPIRE and DCAT metadata standards will be used.

* There is a document, which compares ISO and INSPIRE. The ISO mandatory metadata columns can be extracted from that profile. (http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/Metadata/INSPIRE_MD_IR_and_ISO_v1_2_20100616.pdf)
* The INSPIRE mandatory metadata columns can be extracted from this page (Tables 1 and 2). (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32008R1205)
* Please add a source of DCAT metadata mandatory fields.
* Three above mentioned sources (ISO, INSPIRE and DCAT) overlaps will be analyzed and an "OTN Metadata Profile" will be set up.
